              Albert Brown stepped into a Dunkin’ outlet in Boston’s Government Center and 
              walked up to the counter.<br>
              “Can I get a coconut donut?” he asked.<br>
              “Yeah,” said the cashier. “That’ll be a dollar eighty-nine.”<br>
              <i>A dollar eighty-nine?</i> he thought incredulously. <i>Why do donuts cost so much?
              It’s only a piece of bread!</i>
            </p>
  				</div>
          
  				<div class="step" data-step="2">
  					<p>
              Albert Brown, age 70, was unjustly incarcerated for 39 years as a result of a judicial 
              mistake. When he was freed in June 2022, numerous previously familiar scenes had become 
              unfamiliar. When it comes to the community he loved, everything was changed dramatically 
              from four decades prior. </p>
  				</div>
          
  				<div class="step" data-step="3">
  					<p>“Before the ‘80s, everybody in the community knew me,” said Brown, recalling how his mother would punish him if a neighbor called to tell her of his antics. “If I did something wrong on the street, somebody would call my mother.”</p>
  				</div>
          
          <div class="step" data-step="4">
  					<p>
              Since his release, Brown has worked hard to reintegrate with the community, but found it shocking 
              when only a handful of community members attended a press conference about a recent stabbing at a 
              local community park.<br>
              "The whole community should have been there," Brown said.<br>
            </p>
  				</div>
          
  				<div class="step" data-step="5">
  					<p>
              As an activist, Brown did not merely observe these shifts in his position. Rather, he worked to 
              assist the community as a whole and the younger generation in particular. He regards community as 
              a place to rally people around creating an environment to raise younger generations in a safe and 
              stable environment.
            </p>
  				</div>
          
  				<div class="step" data-step="6">
  				  <p>As soon as Brown was released, he established the Save Our Children and Reclaim Our Communities 
              program – or "SOC and ROC" as he lovingly refers to it – despite having conceived of the idea when 
              he was still incarcerated. His dream is for the program to become a resource for community members 
              as they move their lives forward.
            </p>
  				</div>
          
          <div class="step" data-step="7">
  					<p>
              Brown places a lot of importance on community and he has used his abilities to attempt to make a 
              difference. Meanwhile, his other passion, music, accompanied him for a lifetime and provided an 
              avenue for him to channel his emotions.
            </p>
  				</div>
          
  				<div class="step" data-step="8">
  					<p>
              Unlike contemporary rap music, Brown’s lyrics steer clear of language that invokes what he regards 
              as society’s ills: neglect, violence and substance use. His music penetrates people's hearts more 
              profoundly than the music of others. The listener is able to authentically feel the emotion that he 
              brings, especially for other incarcerated people who were in the same situation as Brown.
            </p>
  				</div>
          
  				<div class="step" data-step="9">
  					<p>
              “All of our conscientious music is about family, community, or issues in our lives,” Brown said, 
              pausing momentarily. “But positive.”
            </p>
  				</div>
          
          <div class="step" data-step="10">
  					<p>
              While incarcerated, Brown collaborated with his co-defendant Jabir Pope and another gentlemen – 
              Jason Jiles, who is still incarcerated – to write “Freedom,” which explores the idea of perseverance 
              in the face of adversities, and finding ways to keep working toward our goals.<br>
              Brown’s musical inclination had a therapeutic effect on other incarcerated people, oftentimes giving 
              them language to express what they otherwise could not.<br>
            </p>
  				</div>
          
          <div class="step" data-step="11">
  					<p>
              In addition to Brown, Pope and Jiles using music to share their sentiments in the institution, 
              Brown claims that many other incarcerated people use their God-given talents in other fields to 
              express their emotions, but the majority of them are distracted by the outside world.<br>
              When asked for tips for today's youth near the end of our interview, Brown paused for a couple of 
              seconds and said, “stop, look, and listen.”
